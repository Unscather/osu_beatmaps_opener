# osu_beatmaps_opener
This program can be used to automatically open .osz files without needing to open osu!. This may be practical for McOsu!, for example.

## Steps
1. Locate your osu! songs folder, and copy the full directory (soimething like ../osu/Songs).
2. Run the executable, and paste the full directory when prompted.
3. Verify your files.

If everything works as anticipated, all .osz files should be removed in place of new folders with the original .osz folder contents!

**NOTES**:
- This script will convert all ZIP files inside your selected directory. This will open the files and delete the original ZIP file.
- This is for classic osu! only! The lazer version does not have a dedicated Songs folder.
